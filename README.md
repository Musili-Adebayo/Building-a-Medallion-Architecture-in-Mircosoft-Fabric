##  Project Summary
For this project, I created the Medallion Architecture for data organisation in a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric. I demonstrated how to level up your data quality from bronze (raw), to silver (validated), and finally to gold (enriched), all ready for super-efficient analytics.
This was my in-person presentation for the [Microsoft Fabric Nigeria Community](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Fabric-Nigeria/gh-p/MicrosoftFabricNigeria) and [dbrownconsulting](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dbrownconsulting_analyticsmeetup-dbrownconsulting-microsoftfabric-activity-7255201470994673668-hX6G?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on 26th of October 2024.
